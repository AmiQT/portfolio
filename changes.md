### 1. Refine Your Professional Headline and Summary

*   **The Idea:** On your home page, your current headline is "Where IT Meets Innovation | Google-Certified Troubleshooter | From Code to Cloud, I Make IT Work". This is good, but could be more direct. Consider a headline that immediately states your value proposition for a corporate environment.
*   **Example:** "A certified IT Support Specialist with a passion for network administration and system efficiency, seeking to contribute to a leading technology team in Malaysia."
*   **Impact on Malaysian MNC Recruiters:** Recruiters, especially in a fast-paced market like Kuala Lumpur or Penang, scan resumes and portfolios quickly. A direct headline immediately tells them who you are and what you want. It shows focus and a clear career direction, which is highly valued in corporate settings.

### 2. Quantify Achievements in Project Descriptions

*   **The Idea:** In your project descriptions, you list "Skills Demonstrated" and "Key Learnings," which is great. Take it a step further by adding quantifiable outcomes.
*   **Example:** For your "Rumah Tenang" landing page, instead of just "Performance Optimization," you could add a bullet point like: "Improved page load speed by 20% through image optimization and efficient code." For the "Nasi Lemak Burger" page, you could say: "Designed a call-to-action that resulted in a 15% click-through rate during a marketing campaign."
*   **Impact on Malaysian MNC Recruiters:** MNCs are data-driven. Showing that you understand and can deliver measurable results, even on personal projects, is a massive advantage. It demonstrates a business-oriented mindset, which is a key differentiator for technical candidates.

### 3. Add a "Career Goals" or "Professional Objective" Section

*   **The Idea:** In your "About Me" page, add a short section outlining your career aspirations.
*   **Example:** "My goal is to secure an IT internship at a multinational company in Malaysia where I can grow my skills in cloud computing and network security. I am eager to contribute to large-scale IT infrastructure and learn from experienced professionals in the industry."
*   **Impact on Malaysian MNC Recruiters:** This shows ambition and that you have a plan. For an MNC, hiring an intern is an investment. They want to see that you are serious about your career and have aspirations that align with the opportunities they can provide. It also shows you've thought about your future, which implies maturity and professionalism.

### 4. Localize Your Content

*   **The Idea:** Subtly tailor your content to the Malaysian context. You can mention your interest in the growing Malaysian tech industry or your eagerness to work with companies that have a strong presence in the region.
*   **Example:** In your "About Me" or "Career Goals," you could mention your excitement about the "MyDIGITAL" blueprint or the tech scene in specific hubs like Cyberjaya or George Town.
*   **Impact on Malaysian MNC Recruiters:** This shows that you are not just sending out generic applications. It indicates a genuine interest in the local industry and the specific company. For an MNC in Malaysia, a candidate who is invested in the local ecosystem is more likely to be a long-term asset.

### 5. Add a Blog or "Writings" Section

*   **The Idea:** Add a simple blog where you write short articles about tech topics you are passionate about. You could write about a new technology you are learning, a challenging problem you solved, or your thoughts on a recent tech trend.
*   **Impact on Malaysian MNC Recruiters:** This is a powerful way to showcase your communication skills, which are critical in a corporate environment. It also demonstrates your passion for technology and your ability to articulate complex ideas clearly. For an MNC, an employee who can communicate well, both verbally and in writing, is incredibly valuable.
